# KWaCC Learning Progress

A journal tracking learning progress through the "Write a C Compiler" book while learning Kotlin.

---

## Session 2025-01-11

### Topics Covered
- Reviewed `Lexer.kt` for bugs, improvements, and Kotlin idioms
- Refactored to eliminate all `!!` null assertions

### Key Learnings

**Kotlin Null Safety:**
- `curChar?.isDigit() == true` is cleaner than `curChar != null && curChar!!.isDigit()`
- Capture mutable `var` into local `val` to enable smart casting: `val ch = curChar ?: return ...`
- Safe call with `== true` works because `null == true` is `false`

**Compiler Design:**
- Error positions should point to token START, not where lexer ends up after consuming
- Captured `beginLine`/`beginColumn` before consuming characters in `lexNumbers()`

**Code Quality:**
- `peek()` and `peekN()` are currently unused - consider removing or keeping for future operators
- Tokens don't carry source positions - will matter when parser needs to report errors
- `TokenType` enum may be redundant with sealed class hierarchy

### Changes Made
- Refactored Lexer to use `?.` safe calls
- Fixed error position tracking in `lexNumbers()`
- Added AI collaboration guidelines to `AGENTS.md`

### Next Session Ideas
- Review Parser implementation
- Review AST design
- Discuss: Should tokens carry source positions?
- Discuss: Next chapter from the book (unary operators? binary expressions?)

## Session 2026-01-12

### Topics Covered
- Removed `TokenType` enum redundancy from `Token.kt`
- Simplified tokenizer loop to use single exit path
- Refined AI collaboration guidelines for better learning

### Key Learnings

**Kotlin Sealed Classes vs Enums:**
- Sealed classes provide exhaustive type checking via `is` pattern matching
- Use sealed classes when variants carry different data (`Identifier(value)`, `Constant(value)`)
- Use enums when variants are just labels with no per-instance data (`KeywordType.INT`, `KeywordType.VOID`)

**Technical Communication:**
- Professional pattern: Observation → Reasoning → Question
- Keep it short and direct — real engineers don't use overly formal language
- Example: "Why two exit conditions? Seems redundant." (not a paragraph)

### Changes Made
- Removed `TokenType` enum from `Token.kt`
- Updated `Parser.kt` to use `is` pattern matching instead of `checkTokenType()`
- Changed tokenizer loop to single exit path via EOF token
- Added comments explaining loop behavior
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with:
  - Discovery-based learning methodology
  - Technical English coaching guidelines
  - Deep learning fundamentals section

### Next Session Ideas
- Review Parser implementation for improvements
- Review AST design
- Add source positions to tokens
- Start next book chapter (unary operators? binary expressions?)
